Hi, I'm Kevin, currently working as a Software Engineer at Accenture. I want to transition my career into web development and aspire to become a Full Stack Developer. 
Currently, I'm learning various tools and skills required for this role, such as HTML and CSS, JavaScript, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and also how to use MongoDB. 
I hope to achieve success in the future as a Full Stack Developer. This page represents my first creation as a Web Developer, featuring a simple design using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I aspire to build more sophisticated and impressive websites in the future. Thank you.
